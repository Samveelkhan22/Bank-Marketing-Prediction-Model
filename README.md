# Bank-Marketing-Prediction-Model
This repository contains the code for predicting customer subscription behavior based on bank marketing data using machine learning models.

## Project Overview
The project is designed to solve a classification problem: predicting whether a customer will subscribe (`yes/no`) based on various features like age, job, marital status, and more. The project consists of the following steps:
1. Data Collection and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, normalization)
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Model Testing and Validation

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) from UCI. The dataset includes customer information from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. Features include customer demographics and interactions with the bank.

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you'll need the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`
